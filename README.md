Crowdsourced brainstorm of problems we want to solve: https://pad.riseup.net/p/BecKdThFsevRmmG_tqFa-keep

# Setup
- Make sure you have Postgres installed
- Create a database in Postgres called cbv3_django_prototype

# Proof-of-concept Goals
A resource datastore
- save resource
- delete resource
- update resource
- list resource
- search resources

Resource:
- title
- description
- type
- credit
- url
- referrer

The start of a resource bookmarking/archiving service.

- Calendar/hangouts
  - How easy would it be to make a calendar widget that lets users block out times they're free for hangouts?
